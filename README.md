# What do you Want?
**What do you want?**  is a small proof of concept game that I made for the Game Makers Toolkit Jam. It's a short platformer, with a built in dialogue tree.  The story is about a teenager having to deal with the death of their father, and the conversation you hear is after the son has started therapy to deal with the loss.

The key is, that you choose what you say based on what platform you land on. I hope to make a game in the future that uses this idea to it's fullest extent, because right now it's just a proof of concept.

Controls:

* A & D/Left & Right - Move
* Spacebar - Jump (hold to jump higher)
* That's it! Very simple.

This is the first "game" that I've ever created and released, so it's not as polished as I'd like, but I hope to get better with time. Hopefully this idea can inspire a few people!
